        <p>
          We strive to bring people interesting and unique art that inspires
          them to be more creative and enjoy their homes. We know art can be
          expensive, so we work with a rotating set of artists and photographers
          to being you fantastic prints - all for free. We just ask that you
          donate what you think is fair, or share the site with someone who
          might like great art as much as you do.
